# Happy-Dog
This is a simple landing page made using Tailwind CSS.
I have used <script > tag in index.html to use tailwind utility classes in the project, because it was not possible to upload node modules directory on github due to size limitations. So if you want to run this project locally usig NPM, just comment the script tag in index.html and uncomment the link tag used to link css file in head of index.html.
